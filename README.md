WEB 12 Unit 5 Evaluation Pending
Problem
Create a Job listing application in react
Use redux to store the data
app has 2 parts, adding new jobs for a company and applying to a job from client.
everyone needs to be logged in first before seeing anything on page.
client should not see any admin page, use protected routes.
admin can add job to the dashboard
users can see the list of jobs.
a job has company name, job title, salary range, job description, location, job type (remote) and anything extra you want to add
user can filter/sort jobs on dashboard
user can apply to any job he likes
use redux for showing jobs list here.
after applying, user can see the list of previously applied jobs
on company side, company can see who can applied to which job
a company can have more than one job posting
bonus points for good and clean UI, clean commented well documented code
